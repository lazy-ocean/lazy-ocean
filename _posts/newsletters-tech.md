<div id='main'>
<p>I'm subscribed to (maybe) one too many tech newsletters. But let me tell you, it is an awesome way to grow as a developer. These are the things I look for most:
</p>

- **Any news on frontend development**: releases and updates, new frameworks/tools/runtimes (it's wild out there), trending discussions and ecosystem news. The frontend world is moving fast, and it's just an incredibly convenient way to keep up with what's happening without having to deal with Twitter's declining state
- **Ideas to try, inspo**: pretty much everything from tech stack and tools to apps and website ideas. I bookmark a crazy amount of things, from pretty websites to UX/a11y recommendations and code snippets, and go back to it regularly to develop my stuff
- **General industry awareness**: by just catching the drift and mood of the articles helps to understand where the industry's pain points are.

<p>So here are my main recommendations:</p>

## Frontend {#frontend}

### **ui.dev**: [Bytes, your weekly dose of JS](https://bytes.dev/)

**In a nutshell:** witty and incredibly useful JS ecosystem digest  
**Neat things:** curated, always-on-point and freshly baked JS trends  
**Latest discovery:** [This collection of CSS snippets you should probably know](https://web.dev/articles/5-css-snippets-every-front-end-developer-should-know-in-2024)

Probably the most entertaining tech newsletter out there. A very useful bunch of links to articles, guides, news and tutorials on all things JS (and frontend, really), spiced up with silly commentary to brighten up any Monday.

<br/>

### **ui.dev**: [React Newsletter](https://reactnewsletter.com/)

**In a nutshell:** all things React, in a short weekly round-up  
**Neat things:** React-centric articles and guides + libraies recommendations  
**Latest discovery:** [This fancy glow effect library](https://github.com/codaworks/react-glow)

Nice and short React newsletter. Due to its rather narrow nature, I often see its articles in other newsletters first, but if you want to subscribe to something React-only, this is a good choice.

         alt="a11y Weekly newsletter" class='blogImg'>
    <figcaption>a11y Weekly description</figcaption>

### [**a11y Weekly**](https://a11yweekly.com/)

**In a nutshell:** tightly packed selection of digital accessibility news and articles  
**Neat things:** very useful guides for a more accessible web  
**Latest discovery:** There's an `<abbr>` element for abbreviations. [But you better not use it](https://adrianroselli.com/2024/01/using-abbr-element-with-title-attribute.html)

I'm trying to "expose" myself more to accessibility content and news, because **a)** repetition is key **b)** it's incredibly useful to read other developers' and users' perspectives on web accessibility, as there's really no one right way to do everything in accordance with standards (take for example the VoiceOver vs. NVDA announcements difference). This newsletter is a great way to share both a11y news and resources.

<br/>

### [**Frontend Focus**](https://frontendfoc.us/) & [**JavaScript Weekly**](https://javascriptweekly.com/)

**In a nutshell:** the most thorough, diverse and comprehensive selection of frontend resources  
**Neat things:** there's literally everything on webdev, from opinion articles to browser news to WebGL tutorials  
**Latest discovery:** [This huge collection of CSS-only loaders](https://css-loaders.com/classic/)

Two of the most packed frontend newsletters, come in a pack as they are very similar in density and usefulness of content. There's a lot going on, which is great, but can also be overwhelming. Each issue has it all: news, tutorials, articles, a selection of tools, and quick links to anything else you might find useful, like TypeScript quirks, accessibility, or security.

<br/>

## Design and inspo {#design}

### **Codrops**: [The Collective Newsletter](https://tympanus.net/codrops/collective/)

**In a nutshell:** an awesome, curated collection of the best websites and webdev resources  
**Neat things:** UX/UI trends, creative websites, animations to steal  
**Latest discovery:** [This gem of a Codepen](https://codepen.io/giana/pen/BabdgjB)

Two in one: a really, really great source of design/webdev inspo + incredibly itchy FOMO slash jealousy of people creating such great stuff, maaan. I regularly add some guides and creative websites to my `inspo` folder.

<br/>

### **Learn UI Design**: [Design Hacks](https://www.learnui.design/newsletter.html)

**In a nutshell:** short UI/UX design lessons on various topics  
**Neat things:** before vs. after UX design improvements, simplified.

It heavily up-sells the existing UI design course from the same author, but is still a nice resource for getting tiny design lessons.
