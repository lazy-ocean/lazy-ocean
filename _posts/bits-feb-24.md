<p>Some things I liked in February'24.</p>

## Books {#books}

**<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(novel)" target="_blank">Trust by Nernan Diaz</a>**: Don't read it if you're easily annoyed by self-centred people. _Trust_ me, just don't. Otherwise a great read about how history is always rewritten by the winners, the ones who stayed alive and the ones who have the most power.

**<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(Crouch_novel)" target="_blank"> Recursion by Blake Crouch</a>**: This is my second book by Blake Crouch, and while the first left me with the feeling "this should be a short sci-fi story instead", **Recursion** is much more balanced and, frankly, less mundane. Even in the most extreme twists and turns, it never leaves you to figure everything out on your own, which can be a bit annoying, so I think it is a decent read for someone who enjoys sci-fi, but only _from time to time_.

## Music

- <a class='spotifyLink' href='spotify:album:1s3ypfinSBGQl36cJSRjOv' target="_blank">Everything Everything's new album</a> is a gem: not the bangers IN YE FACE like their previous album (at least its first half), but a breath of fresh air in their own league of no one else.
- <a class='spotifyLink' href='spotify:track:0eAXtuToazVgRJvKn8Rln9' target="_blank">Sampha</a>, as usual, makes pretty much everyone sound better. Mellow, warm hip-hop that I love so much.
- <a class='spotifyLink' href='spotify:track:6Qb7YsAqH4wWFUMbGsCpap' target="_blank">D U A L I P A</a>. nuff said

<div class="tenor-gif-embed centered" data-postid="4900983108989450570" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1" data-width="30%"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/dua-lipa-fearythings-training-season-music-video-gif-4900983108989450570">Dua Lipa Fearythings GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/dua+lipa-gifs">Dua Lipa GIFs</a></div> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

- A mini rollercoaster ride through the mind of <a class='spotifyLink' href='spotify:album:1qgVGhtiq8P6tfURWqDPX5'>Declan McKenna</a>, taking you on a journey from boring supermarket music to <a class='spotifyLink' href='spotify:track:4nCNS9SexVaW62PGIbAjtF'>the one damn thing</a> that gets stuck in your head for days on end.
- <a class='spotifyLink' href='spotify:track:36FZL9SzRh5BhtG1cUyGWr'>girl in red</a> in her new, but still honest and touching and catchy and raw and whatever awesome self.

Eventful!

## Movies {#movies}

**<a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-holdovers/" target="_blank">The Holdovers</a>**: Such a sweet thing, I really enjoyed the warmth of this movie. Yeah it was a bit difficult at times to zoom out and not think of <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/dead-poets-society/" target="_blank">Dead Poets Society</a> (especially given that I've watched it about 5 times, or more), but even with similarities, it is still a great, quite comforting movie.

**<a href='https://letterboxd.com/film/anatomy-of-a-fall/' target="_blank">Anatony of a Fall</a>**: I really liked how I felt "wow, that's good" and not much else right after watching it, but then I went back to it for a whole week, rethinking whole scenes. _**SPOILER ALERT**_, it leaves you with the same kind of "and that's it?" dissatisfaction, longing for _something_ you don't even know what, it's absolutely fantastic. And Sandra H√ºller has totally won my heart.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet centered"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sandra H√ºller&#39;s defending her child scene in Anatomy of a Fall remains the best performance of 2023 to me. And she deserves more than this. <a href="https://t.co/lMj5EB4K1Z">pic.twitter.com/lMj5EB4K1Z</a></p>&mdash; sharonüïØÔ∏èsandra h√ºller Oscar nominee (@iamsharonle) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamsharonle/status/1759306381876949005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Tech articles {#tech}

**<a target='_blank' href="https://thisiswcag.com/">WCAG simplified</a>**: Not as great as it sounds, but I think the idea is pretty cool: WCAG accessibility standards explained in "human-friendly language" one-liners. It's definitely not enough to have any significant impact, but it's a start.

**<a href="https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/union-intersection-difference-javascript-sets/" target='_blank'>Set.prototype.[union, intersection, difference and more]</a>**: A tidy explainer of what new JS `Set` object methods are available in browsers near you (c) (unless you are a FireFox user, then Nightly it is).

**<a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-trends/" target='_blank'>A comprehensive guide on the hottest React trends we are excited for in 2024</a>**: A nice one to fill your bookmarks with trendy, shiny tools you'd like to use + topics you'd want to read more about. Plus, it serves as a great explanation of what happened in the React space in 2023, in case you were too busy writing code to follow React gossip (good for you, honestly) üíÖ.

## Curiosities {#curiosities}

**<a href="https://www.twobraids.com/2024/01/air-cannon.html" target='_blank'>This lad</a>**, who wrote a Python script to correctly identify the specific area from which the annoying and peace-disturbing agricultural air cannon was blasting day and night. Articles like this make me feel both inspired and useless as a programmer: I really, really like to build something I use myself, but it's not always the easiest task to have both the idea and the right skills/tools (and time) to make something useful. And it is nice to remember that not all of us are working on SaaS or e-commerce...

**<a href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/fermenting-revolution" target='_blank'>How bread revolution paved way for suffragetes</a>**: Firstly, I cannot recommend [Works in Progress](https://www.worksinprogress.news/) enough - a brilliant resource for keeping up with random research/nature/history/science topics. Secondly, this is a beautifully written piece on bread, which brightened the social life of women in the 1920s and opened up avenues for a better life for us all.

And this very beautiful painting:
